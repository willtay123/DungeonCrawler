# DungeonCrawler
My first dungeon crawler attempt. I will be working on this in my spare time between work with the aim of making a polished, complete, game. Since I have no design plans yet, I will be simply experimenting and creating whatever seems fun. Documentation will be expanded over time.

### Architecture
Due to the better performance and logical clarity of Unity's "in-preview" ECS architecture, I will be aiming to use this for my game. As far as I am aware so far, this will make it a little harder to work with in-editor and will rely on more code manipulation, with which I am comfortable. However, this may cause it to take longer to develop.
